# Batch Lighthouse Audit
Run the Chrome Lighthouse Audit on a list of bulk URLs.

How it works:
- Supply the URLs you want to test in your urls.txt file
- Run audit.bat to audit the provided URLs with Chrome Lighthouse (in quiet, headless mode). 
- Each page's results will be outputted as an HTML file

For testing purposes, urls.txt currently contains 10 random articles from Wikipedia.
